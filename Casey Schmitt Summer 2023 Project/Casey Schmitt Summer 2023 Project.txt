Casey Schmitt Summer 2023 Project

June 2nd 2023
Pitch-by-Pitch Visualization: Create an interactive display that allows users to step through each at-bat pitch by pitch. Show the pitch location, type, and outcome (swing and miss, foul ball, hit). Use visual cues like color-coding or icons to represent different outcomes.

Swing Analysis: Explore the player's swing tendencies and outcomes. Show the percentage of swings taken by pitch location (inside, outside, high, low) using a heatmap or grouped bar chart. Additionally, analyze the outcomes of swings, such as contact rate, swinging strike rate, or foul ball rate.

Pitch Type Analysis: Analyze the frequency of different pitch types faced by the player. Create a bar chart or pie chart showing the distribution of pitch types (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) they have encountered. This can give insights into the player's ability to handle specific pitches.

Pitch Velocity Trends: Visualize the player's performance against different pitch velocities over time. Use a line chart to show how their batting average or slugging percentage varies based on the pitch release speed. This can help identify the player's strengths against certain velocity ranges.

At-Bat Outcome Summary: Provide a summary of the player's at-bat outcomes, including events like hits, walks, strikeouts, and home runs. Use a stacked bar chart or a data table to display the frequencies and percentages of each outcome.

Plate Discipline Metrics: Calculate plate discipline metrics such as chase rate (swings at pitches outside the strike zone), contact rate, or walk rate. Display these metrics as a radar chart or side-by-side bar charts to visualize the player's approach at the plate.

Situational Performance: Analyze the player's performance in different game situations, such as bases empty, runners in scoring position, or with two outs. Show statistics like batting average, on-base percentage, or slugging percentage in these specific scenarios using bar charts or grouped bar charts.

Game Logs: Present a log of the player's at-bats, including key details such as the game date, opposing pitcher, pitch type faced, and outcome. This can be displayed as a table or a timeline of at-bats.
