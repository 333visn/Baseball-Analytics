## Purpose

- This is a summer project I made that keeps track of Casey Schmitt's batting stats. Schmitt is currently a rookie 3B for the San Francisco Giants that got the call up this season. He had a very hot start that gave inspiration for this project that I started in early May. The stats will get updated and stop around the end of September when the 2023 regular will soon end.

## Data
- This application has data from the baseballr package. Baseballr is a package written for R
focused on baseball analytics and has data collected from other baseball databses such as FanGraphs,
Baseball-Reference, and baseballsavant.
